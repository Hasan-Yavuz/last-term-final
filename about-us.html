	<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>The Wheel Depot Plus is Ottawa's most trusted center for all things wheels. Whether it's new or used tires and rims, accessories, or maintenance, this one-stop shop has you covered. With prices that can't be beat, unrivaled workmanship and the ability to handle anything with four wheels, the choice is clear for wheels in Ottawa.
So how did The Wheel Depot Plus earn its position atop the industry? Co-Founder John Ianni claims "it's the people. From the start our employees have been passionate people, who have loved cars their whole lives, the same way I have. I think that's why they're such perfectionists about every job they approach." The crew at The Wheel Depot Plus is not only passionate but qualified: only trained, experienced technicians are hired to handle the most important part of your vehicle.
The Wheel Depot Plus sells both new and used tires and rims, and we have something for every budget. We have the capability of working on everything from domestic vehicles through to high-end, exotic supercars. Only top-of-the-line parts and equipment are used.</p>
	
	<h2>How We Save You Money</h2>
		<p>One basic way we can save you money is an option overlooked by many: used tires. An obvious concern with used tires is, "can I rely on them?" The Wheel Depot Plus has a system in place to ensure the answer is yes! We only sell used tires with over 50% tread life remaining. This quality inspection gives you a level of knowledge about the product that would otherwise be impossible, so you can buy used tires with the same peace-of-mind as new tires.
We receive new shipments of used tires weekly. In addition, we re-sell used tires we've removed from cars when they pass the tread life inspection. By doing so, and by taking part in the Ontario Tire Stewardship program, we keep our disposal costs way down - savings which transfer directly to you, the customer.
How else can we save you money? Here's a tip: check the tires on your lease before returning it. You may be charged an unfair amount for tires that are too worn. By replacing them with used tires from The Wheel Depot Plus, you can save money.</p>
